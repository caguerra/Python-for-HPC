Although vanilla Python is fairly slow and hence not a good candidate,
there are several options to significantly increase the efficiency of
Python programs.


## Learning outcomes

When you complete this training you will

  * understand and identify performance bottlenecks of Python;
  * know some libraries that can help improve performance for scientific
    computing such as numpy, numexpr and numba;
  * be able to use Cython to improve your code's performance;
  * be able to wrap C, C++ and Fortran code to use it from Python;
  * understand the opportunities and pitfalls of multi-threaded
    programming with Python;
  * be able to write distributed application using MPI;
  * have an understanding of how frameworks for distributed
    computing such as dask and pyspark work.

## Training materials

Slides are available in the
 [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gjbex/Python-for-HPC),
as well as example code and hands-on material.


## Software environment

Instructions on [how to create the required software environment](software_stack.md)
are available.


## Target audience

This training is for you if you need to use Python for computationally
intensive scientific computing.


## Prerequisites

You will need experience programming in Python, using numpy, and have a passing
familiarity with C/C++.  This is not a training that starts from scratch.

If you plan to do Python programming in a Linux or HPC environment you should
be familiar with these as well.

# Integrating C, C++ and Fortran code with Python

Two ways to integrate C/C++ code are illustrated, using `ctype` and
SWIG.  For Fortran code, `f2py` is used.

## What is it?

* `Ctypes`: examples of using functions defined in a shared library.
* `F2py`: examples of binding Fortran code using f2py.
* `Pybind11`: example of binding C++ code using pybind11.
* `Swig`: examples of binding C and C++ code using SWIG.

# Swig

SWIG provides a nice way to wrap C and C++ code into interfaces for
several scripting languages such as Python.

## What is it?

* `logistic_map.[ch]`: function that computes the logistic map for a
    given number of steps, an initial value, and a factor.  This is
    compiled into a shared library, or, using `logistic_map.i` and
    `SWIG` to generate a wrapper, into `_log_map.so` shared library.
* `logistic_map.i`: SWIG file describing the function in `logistic_map.c`
    so that a C wrapper can be generated using `swig` and together with
    the C file to produce a shared library.  Functions can be directly
    imported from that library using the Python wrapper generated by
    `swig`.
* `main.c`: C driver for the logistic map.
* `params.txt`: parameter-weaver file describing the command line
    arguments for `main.c`.
* `point.[chi]`: C implementation of a point as a structure, and SWIG
    declaration file.
* `point_swig.py`: uses `point.c` generated module.
* `point_class.[cxx,h,i]`: a C++ class defining point objects, and
    corresponding SWIG declaration file.
* `point_class_swig.py`: uses `point_class.cxx` generated module.
* `stats.[chi]`: defines a function that takes an array of `double`
    as argument, and returns a structure, with corresponding SWIG
    declaration file.
* `stats_swig.py`: uses `stats.c` generated module.
* `python-interfacing.pptx`: Powerpoint presentation introducing
    interfacing with C, C++, and Fortran

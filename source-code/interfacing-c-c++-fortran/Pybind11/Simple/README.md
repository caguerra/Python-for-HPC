# Simple

A very simple example of how to use pybind11 to interface with
C++ code.


## What is it?

1. `computations.cpp`: implementation of some C++ functions.
1. `computations.h`: declaration of some C++ functions.
1. `computations_bind.cpp`: pybind11 wrapper code.
1. `Makefile`: make file to build the extension.

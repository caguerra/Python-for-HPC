Multiprocessing
===============

Multiprocessing is Python's standard library to write multithreaded
applications fairly easily.

What is it?
-----------
1. `squares.py`: each thread computes the square of a number
1. `pi.py`: the value of pi is stochastically computed, each thread
   performing its share of the total number of iterations required
1. `multi_count.py`: count amino acids in a long sequence, distributing
   the work over threads
7. `large_dna.txt`: example data file to use with `mpi_count.py`

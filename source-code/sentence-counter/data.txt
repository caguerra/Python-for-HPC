This is a short text with a number of sentneces.  Each sentence should
be counted, where sentence delimitors would be a dot, a question mark and
and exclamation mark.  Sentences can span multiple lines as well.  Although
this seems a simple task, it is nevertheless interesting because it can
be parallelized using MPI.
The sequential version should reflect the approach that will be taken
by the parallel version as well.
